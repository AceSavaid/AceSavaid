Hello, My name is Alannis Davis but you can call me Ace.  
I’m interested in game development and digital art.  
My current main programming languages are C, C++ and C# but I use HTML, JavaScript and Markdown for slight website design and formating as well.  
I currently am working in Unity and Unreal Engine 5.  
I'm interested in networking and building new connections.  I also am looking for a parttime or internship job in software or game development.   

Roles in game development 
- Gameplay Programmer
- UI Programmer
- Graphic Programmer
- Systems Programmer
- Project Manager
