Hello, I am Alannis Davis but I also go by Ace Savaid online. 
I’m interested in game development and programming.  
My current main programming languages are C++ and C# but I also have experience working in R and Javascript.  
I am currently working in Unity and Unreal Engine 5 for various projects and prototypes.  
I'm interested in networking and building new connections.  
I am also looking for an internship in software development or game development while in University as well as a permanent job after my studies are completed.   

Roles in game development 
- Gameplay Programmer
- UI Programmer
- Graphic Programmer
- Systems Programmer
- Project Manager
